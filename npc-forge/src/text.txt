Generate a detailed NPC with the following fields as a JSON object:

- name: a fantasy-style name with a nickname or title  
- race: a fantasy race (e.g. Human, Elf, Tiefling, Dwarf, etc.)  
- role: the NPCâ€™s social role or occupation (e.g. merchant, beggar, blacksmith, thief)  
- goal: the main ambition or objective of the NPC  
- flaw: a personal weakness or character flaw  
- secret: a hidden truth or secret about the NPC  
- catchphrase: a typical phrase or saying the NPC often uses, in quotes  

Make the NPC vivid and believable. Output only the JSON object, nothing else.

  "race": "Tiefling",
  "role": "Beggar",
  "goal": "Join the Thieves' Guild",
  "flaw": "Lies compulsively",
